# FP4 - Final Project Writeup


# FP2 - Evaluation of the Final project


# FP1 - Proposal for Critique

**Design 1: Cocktail**

For this design, I want to create an interactive website on cocktail recipients. The user will be able to explore different cocktail recipients, practice mixing a drink, and build their own recipes to save on the website. I want to create this project mainly because I like to mix drinks during leisure hours.

Interaction: I imagine three main screens
The main screen displays each drink.

When clicked on each drink, it would direct to an informational page that displays the cocktail's recipe and how to create the cocktail.

The last page would be a mini-game-like page allowing the user to practice mixing cocktails with the liquor bottles. Further, I also envision users creating their custom drinks and being added to the home page.

**Design 2: Calligraphy**

For this project, I want to create an informative, interactive website that introduces the history and art of Chinese Calligraphy. I’m motivated to create this project as a way to educate more people about this very important element of my culture and heritage.

Interaction: I imagine two main pages for this project

This page displays the history and transformation of Chinese calligraphy from the very first characters to modern Chinese characters. When the page scrolls, the font element stays in place but transforms from phase to phase while the text scrolls up.

The second page would display a character, and when hovered over, it would highlight a specific stroke from the character. When clicked on, it would direct the user to a page specific to the stroke with other information regarding it.

**Design 3: Portfolio Revamp**

For this project, I want to create some more interactive elements on top of my current portfolio on the homepage and about me page. My motivation is to display my design capabilities and increase my competitive advantage as a designer in the job market.

Interaction: 
For the home page, I imagine a better display of the different projects, as well as the ability for users to preview an existing project by hovering over a small section.

For the about me page, I’m imagining a sandbox area with blocks of “interesting things” that can be interacted with by dragging and dropping with simulated physics. Each box would open a window with images and artifacts related to my interests.

**Critique Summary:**

Regarding the feedback I received from the critique, there is a common theme of scoping down for the first two projects, where it is important to pick a few topics to work on rather than building all 50+ characters/drinks. Before this critique session, I had concerns about an API, but I clarified what I wanted to do afterward. Another general feedback would be that people enjoyed each project sketch's potential interactions and want to see more interesting interactions. 

For the cocktail project, the audience liked the visual and interactive potential of the cocktail glasses, especially the different cup shapes and cocktail drinks. As the website is very graphic intensive, concerns have been raised about the accessibility of the graphics, which would make it harder for screen readers and other accessibility tools to use the website. Further, there are issues related to the complexity of managing the ingredients and using 3D renders, and an alternative 2D graphic was suggested for easier implementation. There are also concerns about the complexity of managing pouring animations, sliding animations, etc, on the 3rd making cocktail screen.

The feedback on the calligraphy website was very positive overall, especially on the potential between information and visuals. The project was also suggested to be scoped down to avoid being too much to handle for this project. A section about the general order of the strokes for the characters was also suggested. 

For the portfolio revamp, the critiques emphasized creating an engaging experience that doesn’t overshadow the actual projects. There is positive feedback regarding the drag-and-drop feature, but it would work better as a stand-alone feature rather than as the main feature implemented. There are also concerns about this feature working on mobile devices, especially with complex animations. 

**Feedback:**

After the critique session in the lab, I decided to work on the calligraphy project. One of the main critiques I will be taking in is to narrow the scope to avoid the overwhelming complexity of the project. This critique has helped me, as when I was still sketching out the project, the general size was one big concern I had when proceeding with the project. To keep things focused, I will concentrate on one specific historical period of Chinese calligraphy for the components/strokes of calligraphy. Further, I will only use a few characters as examples, try to generalize the strokes, and not make them hyperspecific. This way, I can dive deeper into the details and keep the workload more manageable within the time I have.
One critique I had was to include the stroke orders of characters. I would take part in that suggestion by including it as a small section with generalized information but not hyper-specific for every character. This makes the project better scoped while also providing necessary information for the users.
