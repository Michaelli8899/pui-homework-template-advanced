Dynasty: Han 汉 and onward (206 BCE–Present)
Script Name: Cursive Script (草书, Cǎoshū)
Cursive Script developed alongside Clerical Script for informal writing. Known for its speed and artistic expression, Cursive Script allows for quicker strokes and is less concerned with legibility than with fluidity and spontaneity.
Key Characteristics
Flowing and Continuous: Strokes are often connected, with characters written in a single, flowing motion, which emphasizes speed over clarity.
Abbreviated Forms: Characters are simplified, with some strokes omitted or merged, creating a more abstract appearance.
Expressive and Free-Form: Cursive Script allows for personal style, with each calligrapher interpreting characters in their own way, often sacrificing structure for artistic flair.
Character for Fish
Body: The body is reduced to a single, sweeping line or curve, with minimal detail to allow for quick execution.
Tail: The tail is often a simple flick or curve at the end, hinting at its shape without clear separation.
Fins: The fins may be implied through slight curves or omitted altogether for simplicity.
Head and Eye: The eye is either a small mark or suggested by the flow of the line, emphasizing movement over distinct details.
