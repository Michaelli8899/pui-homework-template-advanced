Dynasty: Qin 秦 (221–206 BCE)
Script Name: Seal Script (篆书, Zhuànshū)
Seal Script was standardized during the Qin Dynasty under Emperor Qin Shi Huang. This script was used on official seals, inscriptions, and stone carvings. Seal Script marked a significant evolution towards a more standardized form of Chinese writing and laid the foundation for later scripts.
Key Characteristics
Rounded and Curvilinear: Seal Script is characterized by smooth, flowing lines and rounded forms, making the characters appear more elegant and decorative compared to earlier scripts.
Symmetrical and Balanced: Each character is carefully structured, with symmetrical strokes and balanced proportions, giving it a sense of harmony and formality.
Uniform Stroke Thickness: Unlike later scripts, Seal Script maintains a consistent thickness in each stroke, which makes it ideal for carving into stone or metal.
Character for Fish
Body: The body is elongated and slender, with smooth curves and a vertically oriented, rounded shape that reflects the script's elegance.
Tail: The tail is represented by a rounded, symmetrical shape with two small upward curves, adding a graceful finish.
Fins: The fins are depicted as subtle, short curves on either side of the body, contributing to the balanced structure.
Head and Eye: The eye is a small dot near the top, incorporated seamlessly into the flowing form, adding to the unity and decorative quality of the character.
